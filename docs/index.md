# About

Hey! Welcome to the ShooterGame LTS Documentation. You're probably here because you want to understand some of the fundamentals about ShooterGame LTS. This Documentation aims to be a better resource than [the official Epic provided one](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Resources/SampleGames/ShooterGame/) for learning ShooterGame and the new concepts i've introduced to it. Enjoy your stay.

Please do remember I (Snaps) am just one person, and so not *everything* may be documented. But know that I will try my best and this documentation will hopefully improve over time. <3

Also if you haven't yet found your way there, come join the [discord](https://discord.gg/GQW7cGJpzZ)!
