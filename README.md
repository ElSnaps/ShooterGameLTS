# ShooterGame Long-term Support

## Introduction

ShooterGame LTS (Long-term support) is a port of ShooterGame to Unreal Engine 5 with the goal to modernize, fix and generally maintain the now defunct & adandoned ShooterGame. Support starts at Unreal Engine 5.1.

If you're like me, Lyra felt a little bit overwhelming, over-engineered and more of a showcase than an appropriate replacement for ShooterGame which acted for many as a template. This project exists to solve that problem.
